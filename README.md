## Learning Objectives
This session is designed to introduce you to Cisco Workflows and give you hands on practice.

## Getting Started
#### Lab Access
Cisco Worklfows is hosted in the Meraki Dashboard.  Open a browswer and navigate to https://dashboard.meraki.com.  
You'll use the credentials assigned to you by your Lab Admin.

## Connect your accounts
#### We'll need to connect Workflows to your lab environments.

Workflows offer pre-built automations (activities) for solutions such as Meraki, Catalyst
Center, Catalyst SD-WAN, Cisco ISE, ServiceNow, and more. In this lab, we will walk you
through key components of Workflows and demonstrate a pre-built Meraki workflow
ready for use.
